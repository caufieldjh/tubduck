TUBDUCK
=======

TUBDUCK is a system and accompanying platform for Translating Unstructured Biomedical Data into Unified, Coherent 
Knowledgebases. 

It renders experimental and clinical text as graphs, for integration into a knowledge graph. 

TUBDUCK is designed to be domain-sensitive, particularly for cardiovascular disease research and cardiovascular clinial case reports.

TUBDUCK is a work in progress.

The primary requirement for this package is Neo4j (both the Python package providing the Bolt driver and the server itself - Community Edition works well). Note that Neo4j requires one of the following Java runtimes: Oracle(R) Java 8, OpenJDK, or IBM J9. TUBDUCK will configure the server and database during the setup stage, assuming no Neo4j database yet exists on the system.

TUBDUCK is designed for Linux only at this time.
