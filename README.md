# TUBDUCK

TUBDUCK is a system and accompanying platform for Translating Unstructured Biomedical Data into Unified, Coherent 
Knowledgebases. 

It renders experimental and clinical text as graphs, for integration into a knowledge graph. 

TUBDUCK is designed to be domain-sensitive, particularly for cardiovascular disease research and cardiovascular clinial case reports.

TUBDUCK is a work in progress.

TUBDUCK is designed for Linux only at this time.

## Requirements

0. Make sure your Python version is at least 3.7:
    
    `python3 -V`

1. Install all requirements first as:

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

2. Set up a Neo4j server. This can be done locally or remotely (option *a* or option *b*).

    *a)* Install Neo4j - Community Server works well.  See https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community for distribution-specific instructions. Note that Neo4j requires one of the following Java runtimes: Oracle(R) Java 8, OpenJDK, or IBM J9. On Ubuntu and other Debian distributions, Neo4j installation goes like this:

    `wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -`

    `echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable latest' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list`

    `sudo apt-get update`

    `sudo apt-get install neo4j`

    Once installation is complete, start the Neo4j server:
    
    `sudo systemctl start neo4j`

    Set the username and password through the browser (usually accessible at http://localhost:7474/) beforehand: login the first time with "neo4j" and "neo4j", as username and password, respectively. Keep the username as "neo4j" but specify a new password. Then specify all environment variables as in Step 3 below.

    *b)* Set up a remote Neo4j database instance. 
    
    This can be done through the Neo4j Sandbox (https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2). Once you've signed in and started a blank sandbox, set the following environment variables on the client (i.e., the machine you are running TUBDUCK on) as specified in step 3 below.

    Amazon Web Services also provides Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for Neo4j Community Edition: see https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Neo4j-Neo4j-Graph-Database-Community-Edition/B071P26C9D
    
    Or, if you would prefer to use the Google Cloud Platform, there are instructions for that here: https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-cloud-google-image/
    
    Irrespective of the remote platform used, environment variables will need to be specified as above so TUBDUCK knows how to connect to the database.
    
3. Set Neo4j environment variables. Enter the following at the command line:

    `export NEO4J_USER="neo4j"`
    
    `export NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"` - replacing *password* with whatever you set it as

    `export NEO4J_HOST="ip.address.goes.here"`- yes, replace that with the actual IP address. For a local server, this will be "localhost".

    `export NEO4J_PORT=12345` - note the lack of quotes. Use the port specified by the remote instance. For a local server, this port is 7687 by default.

## Running the first time

Make sure your Neo4j database is running, based on how you set it up (see above).

Run TUBDUCK as follows from its root directory:

`./tubduck.sh`

This may take a while as it will, by default, load all knowledge sources to populate the database. You can test whether initial configurations are working first by running the following instead:

`./test_tubduck.sh`

This script will run TUBDUCK with the option *--test_load_db*, loading just a small fraction of each knowledge source.

## Troubleshooting

### Neo4j authentication issues

When setting up the Neo4j database, it may raise an error like *Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized: The client is unauthorized due to authentication failure.* Ensure you've set up the initial password as described above. Otherwise, stop the server and remove any previously existing database(s) as follows:

`sudo systemctl stop neo4j`

`sudo rm -rf /var/lib/neo4j/data/`

Then restart the Neo4j server as above.

### Neo4j encryption issues

Neo4j 4.0 made some changes to encryption defaults - encryption is disabled by default.

See details here: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/12392

This likely won't require changes to your settings, but it's good to be aware of.

### Errors about the SQLite3 database

Python versions earlier than 3.7 will cause the following error: *TypeError: argument 1 must be str, not PosixPath*.

The solution is to use Python 3.7 or newer. Sorry, that's just how this one goes.
