AB  - Introduction: The normal coronary circulation is physiologically interconnected
      by intercoronary and intracoronary anastomoses that are functionally
      insignificant and cannot be visualized by conventional coronary angiography due
      to their small size. The development of significant coronary stenosis increases
      the flow through these anastomoses and hence their size, making them readily
      visible. Large intercoronary communications in the absence of obstructive
      coronary artery disease constitute a very rare coronary artery anomaly, which is 
      thought to be congenital in origin and located in specific anatomic locations.
      Case presentation: A 62-year-old man was admitted to our department due to
      typical anginotic pain. Coronary angiography revealed a subtotal occlusion of the
      proximal circumflex and a very unusual tortuous intercoronary communication
      between the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. A 
      drug eluting stent was successfully deployed at the circumflex and the patient's 
      symptoms resolved. Medical history was retaken revealing that he suffered a
      strong blunt trauma of the chest as an adolescent, which we believe could be a
      possible alternative explanation for the formation of the intercoronary
      communication. Comparison to a previous angiogram performed 4 years earlier
      showed that the intercoronary communication was already present and remained
      unchanged over the years. Discussion: It is suggested that intercoronary
      communication arising from unusual locations and developing in disorganized
      fashion can be suspected as being of traumatic origin. We believe that there is
      no need for intervention to treat this type of anomaly.
