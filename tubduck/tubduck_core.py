This is the primary file for TUBDUCK.
It is intended to call all submethods as modules.

TUBDUCK is a system and accompanying platform for
Translating Unstructured Biomedical Data into Unified, Coherent 
Knowledgebases. It renders experimental and clinical text as graphs,
for integration into a knowledge graph. TUBDUCK is designed to be
domain-sensitive, particularly for cardiovascular disease research
and cardiovascular clinial case reports.
